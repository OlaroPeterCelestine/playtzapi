🔐 Role: Admin (with full system permissions)

✅ Tested locally - Login works!


HOW TO USE:
-----------

1. For Local Development:
   - Start server: go run main.go
   - Login at: http://localhost:8080/static/login.html
   - Or use API: POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login
   - Body: {"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}

2. For Railway Deployment:
   - First, fix the 502 error (server not running)
   - Then login at: https://playtzapi-production.up.railway.app/static/login.html
   - Or use API: POST https://playtzapi-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/login
   - Body: {"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}
   - Make sure to include: credentials: 'include' in fetch requests


IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------

⚠️  Railway 502 Error:
   - The Railway server is currently returning 502 Bad Gateway
   - This means the application is not running on Railway
   - You need to:
     1. Check Railway dashboard for errors
     2. Ensure environment variables are set (DATABASE_URL, CORS_ORIGINS, etc.)
     3. Restart the Railway service
     4. Check Railway logs for startup errors

⚠️  CORS Errors:
   - CORS errors appear because Railway is returning 502
   - Once Railway server is running, CORS should work (already configured)
   - Make sure CORS_ORIGINS includes: http://localhost:3001

✅ Local Testing Works:
   - Admin login tested successfully on localhost:8080
   - Session management working
   - Ready to use once Railway is fixed
